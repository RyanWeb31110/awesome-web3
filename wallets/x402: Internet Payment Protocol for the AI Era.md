## 1. From Inscriptions to x402: A Paradigm Shift from Storage to Payment

### 1.1 The Inscription Revolution: Breakthrough in On-Chain Storage

In 2023, the Ordinals protocol initiated an on-chain asset revolution:

- **Core Innovation**: A standardized method for writing data into Bitcoin transactions
- **Technical Implementation**: Anyone can use code to inscribe data on Bitcoin
- **Value Creation**: Converting images, text, and tokens into on-chain assets

**Core Problem Solved by Inscriptions**: How to get on-chain (store value)

### 1.2 The Mission of x402: A New Standard for Value Transfer

The x402 protocol targets an even bigger problem: **How to settle (transfer value)**

If inscriptions are the "switch for writing data on-chain," then x402 is the "switch for writing money on the internet."

---

## 2. x402 Protocol Technical Principles

### 2.1 What is x402

**Definition in One Sentence**: x402 is an internet-native payment protocol that enables web pages, AI, and APIs to charge autonomously.

### 2.2 Technical Implementation

The x402 protocol revives a long-shelved HTTP status code: `402 Payment Required`, redefining it as an internet-native payment channel.

**Workflow**:

```
1. Client (human or AI) accesses a paid interface
   ↓
2. Server returns 402 status code: "Payment Required: 0.05 USDC"
   ↓
3. Automatically completes cryptocurrency payment
   ↓
4. Server returns requested data/service
```

### 2.3 Core Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **No Registration Required** | No account, no login needed |
| **No Bank Card Required** | Entire process uses cryptocurrency (USDC, NET Dollar, etc.) |
| **Machine-Usable** | AI Agents can autonomously complete the payment process |
| **Micropayment Friendly** | Supports settlements as small as $0.001 |
| **Cross-Platform Interoperability** | Supports value flow across websites and services |

### 2.4 Comparison with Traditional Payment

| Dimension | Traditional Payment (API Key) | x402 Protocol |
|-----------|-------------------------------|---------------|
| Registration Process | Account registration required | No registration |
| Identity Verification | API Key management required | Based on cryptocurrency wallet |
| Billing Method | Monthly/annual subscription | Pay-per-use |
| AI Friendliness | Requires manual configuration | AI can complete autonomously |
| Cross-Platform | Separate configuration per platform | Unified protocol standard |

---

## 3. Why the AI Era Needs x402

### 3.1 The Transformation of Internet Protagonists

**Traditional Internet Era**: Humans are the main users

**AI Era**: AI Agents become the main "users"

### 3.2 Economic Behavior of AI Agents

Future AI will:

- Search for information, call AI models
- Purchase computing power, call third-party APIs
- Hire other AI Agents to complete specific tasks
- Autonomously conduct data transactions and service procurement

### 3.3 Pain Points of AI Payment

**Problem**: AI can't swipe credit cards and cannot handle traditional identity verification processes

**Solution**: x402 provides a payment standard that machines can understand and execute

### 3.4 Four Major Advantages of x402

1. **Machine-to-Machine Payment (M2M)**: AI can automatically complete payment processes
2. **Micropayment Settlement**: Can efficiently process payments as small as $0.001
3. **Cross-Service Interoperability**: Unified protocol standard
4. **Stablecoin Settlement**: Avoids price volatility risk (USDC, NET Dollar)

**Core Value**: HTTP enables web page interoperability, x402 enables value interoperability

---

## 4. The Wealth Effect of Technical Standards

### 4.1 Historical Experience: Protocol as Wealth

The fundamental reason for the inscription explosion in 2023: **No one expected that a line of code could open up an entirely new economic system**

The same logic is repeating with x402:

- x402 is not a project
- x402 is not an application
- x402 is an **open standard**

### 4.2 Network Effect of Standards

Once a standard is widely adopted:

```
Standard setting → Developer integration → Application explosion → User growth → Ecosystem prosperity
```

The entire world will build applications around this standard, forming an irreversible network effect.

### 4.3 First-Wave Builder Advantage

| Project | Chain | Current Price | Market Cap | Core Function |
|---------|-------|---------------|------------|---------------|
| PING | Base | $0.05 | $52.97M | First x402 token, driving ecosystem adoption |
| SANTA | Base | $0.02 | $14.51M | AI agent fund management, public goods funding |
| Daydreams | Solana | $0.01 | $11.62M | AI agent framework, supporting on-chain task execution |
| Heurist | Base/zkSync | $0.04 | $7.98M | Decentralized AI cloud service platform |
| Aurra | Base | $0.01 | $5.97M | AI agent hosting platform |
| Gloria AI | Base | $0.01 | $3.29M | News data provider |
| Meridian | Multi-chain | $0.16 | $2.73M | Multi-chain settlement validator |

History proves: **Participating in construction during the early stages of standard popularization often yields the greatest first-mover advantage**

### 4.4 Cognitive Upgrade

> "When you didn't understand inscriptions, it was because you didn't realize they weren't images, but protocols."

Now the same applies — **x402 is not a project, but a standard**

---

## 5. Inscriptions vs x402: Two Value Creation Models

### 5.1 Core Difference Comparison

| Dimension | Inscriptions (Ordinals) | x402 Protocol |
|-----------|-------------------------|---------------|
| **Problem Solved** | How to get on-chain (storage) | How to settle (transfer) |
| **Core Action** | User → Initiate transaction → Write to block | AI → Make request → Complete payment → Obtain data |
| **Content Written** | Data (images, text) | Value flow (payment records) |
| **Driving Force** | Speculative sentiment | Real usage demand |
| **Growth Method** | Emotional ignition | Application growth |
| **Essential Positioning** | On-chain art | AI economic infrastructure |

### 5.2 From Speculation to Usage

**Wealth Effect of Inscriptions**: Mainly from short-term hype and FOMO sentiment

**Value Accumulation of x402**: Based on real payment transaction volume

> This time, wealth comes not from hype, but from usage frequency. The more transactions, the more valuable the protocol.

## 7. Historical Lessons: Successful and Failed Protocols

### 7.1 Successful Protocol Standards

#### ERC-721 (2017)
- **Innovation**: Defined the NFT standard
- **Impact**: Opened up the NFT market (OpenSea, artworks, game items)
- **Market Cap**: Tens of billions of dollars in market size

#### ERC-1155 (2018)
- **Innovation**: Multi-token standard
- **Impact**: Gave blockchain games an economic system
- **Applications**: Axie Infinity, Gods Unchained

#### Ordinals / BRC-20 (2023)
- **Innovation**: Inscription protocol on Bitcoin
- **Impact**: Inscription wealth wave
- **Feature**: Anyone can issue assets

**Common Point**: Once a technical standard is activated, it can create an entirely new wealth system

### 7.2 Failed Case: ERC-404

#### Why Did ERC-404 Fail?

**Timeline**:
- Early 2024: Explosive popularity: "The ultimate fusion of tokens + NFTs"
- 3 months later: No one cared

**Failure Analysis**:

| Problem | Specific Manifestation |
|---------|------------------------|
| **Complex Narrative** | Technical concept too "engineering-focused," retail investors couldn't understand |
| **Lack of Practicality** | Most users had no use for it |
| **No Real Demand** | Projects self-hyping and self-holding |
| **Fragile Ecosystem** | Standard didn't land, ecosystem didn't sustain |
| **Lack of Culture** | Failed to form "participation = consensus = identity" Meme culture |

**Representative Projects**: Pandora, DeFrogs, Numoen — all went silent

#### ERC-404 vs x402

**Comparison from Capital Flow Perspective**:

| Dimension | ERC-404 | x402 |
|-----------|---------|------|
| Capital Source | Short-term hype | Narrative + New demand + Real implementation |
| Essence | Speculating on protocol | Using protocol |
| Meme Attributes | Hyped-up Meme | Meme you can spend money with |
| Life Cycle | 3-month flash in the pan | Continuous application-driven |

### 7.3 Key Difference

**ERC-404**: Technology was fine, but narrative lacked soul

**x402**: Hit the key trend — **AI × Web3 × Payment**

When $PING used x402 for the "pay-per-mint" model, it transformed from an engineering experiment to "Ordinals 2.0 for the masses":

- 1 USDC per mint, like a coin-operated machine
- Mint, earn, and participate in "technological revolution" simultaneously
- Formed the Meme soul of "technology + participation equals wealth"

## 8. Market Performance and Community Consensus

### 8.1 Development Timeline

- **February 2025**: x402 protocol first released (developer small circle)
- **September 2025**: Entered formal standardization/ecosystem promotion phase
- **Current Stage**: Became a network-wide focus due to $PING's 150x surge

### 8.2 Market Performance

Currently, the x402 sector has only produced one 100x coin ($PING), with market performance as follows:

| Token | Current Price (USD) | Market Cap (USD) | 24h Change | 7d Change | 24h Volume | Ecosystem Position |
|-------|--------------------|--------------------|------------|-----------|------------|-------------------|
| PING | $0.07 | $69.8M | 104.90% | +1,516% (since launch) | $78.9M | Protocol flagship token, ecosystem leader |
| SANTA | $0.02 | $16.7M | 156.60% | 496.00% | $7.6M | AI agent coordination platform |
| PAYAI | $0.02 | $23.4M | 122.40% | 340.20% | $12.7M | Multi-chain payment facilitator |
| AURA | $0.01 | $6.5M | 87.70% | 496.20% | $4.7M | AI hosting platform |
| HEU | $0.04 | $7.4M | 13.80% | 207.20% | $2.0M | AI cloud infrastructure |
| DREAMS | $0.01 | $11.2M | 4.70% | 165.60% | $4.3M | LLM inference router |

### 8.3 Risk Assessment

**Concerns**:

- x402 popularity has not yet reached the level of ERC-721 or inscriptions
- Risk of repeating ERC-404's fate
- If only developers pay attention, early entrants may get trapped

### 8.4 Optimistic Factors

From the comparison chart, x402 seems likely to go further:

| Stage | ERC-404 | x402 |
|-------|---------|------|
| Concept Phase | "NFT + Token Fusion" | "AI + Web + Payment Protocol" |
| Hype Point | Engineer discussion | Coinbase/Cloudflare endorsement |
| Retail Entry | High minting threshold, technically complex | 1 USDC minting, accessible to everyone |
| Consensus Core | "Tech revolution" but too abstract | "AI will automatically pay me" - concrete and exciting |
| Meme Core | Engineering dream | "Machine pays money" story more engaging |
| Narrative Sustainability | Weak, no landing applications | AI, blockchain games, Agent scenarios to sustain |

**Key Differences**:

1. **Meme Culture**: x402 has formed a "Meme you can spend money with"
2. **Real Demand**: AI × Web3 × Payment is a definite trend
3. **Low Participation Threshold**: 1 USDC to participate, similar to early Ordinals

### 8.5 Formation of Community Consensus

x402 is not a new chain, nor a token, but a **protocol standard**

The turning point when protocol meets application:

```
Engineer small circle → $PING pay-per-mint → Mass participation → Meme culture formation
```

This bridge of "technology + participation equals wealth" is the soul of Meme

- Then it's ERC-404 2.0
- Short-term hype, long-term silence

**If dozens of projects integrate**:
- AI Agents, blockchain games, API markets all integrate x402 settlement
- Then it's the "Ordinals moment of the AI era"

### 10.3 Value Judgment

**HTTP enables web page interoperability, x402 enables value interoperability**

The true value of x402:

- Not a short-term hot topic
- Not Meme hype
- But **the activation signal for a new layer of the internet**

### 10.4 Participation Strategy

**Understand the Standard**:
- x402 is not a coin, but a "channel"
- In the future, all AI, web pages, and APIs may integrate

**Focus on Usage Data**:
- Transaction volume growth
